opengl-solar-system
===================

#### REQUIREMENTS

For this project, I used Visual Studio Express 2010. 

You will need to install the following for this program to run: 
* OpenGL
* GLUT

#### PROJECT

I created this project for a software development class. It's very basic, and nothing special. Any critique is appreciated and welcome. Please contact me at dori.p.chan@gmail.com! 

### KNOWN ISSUES
* The code is beefy. I could have made things easier for myself by using display lists.
* Mouse controls are wonky 
* Textures don't wrap perfectly 

### CREDITS
For SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library), which I used to easily use textures in this program:
* Jonathan Dummer
* Sean Barret
* Dan Venkitachalam
* & gamedev.net

...and also Nehe Productions (http://nehe.gamedev.net/)
